Starknet Specs Flattener
===

This Rust program will download the [Starknet OpenRPC specs](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs), apply various transformation such as inlining components and _required_ arrays, split these specs into a file per method, and write the overall output in the directory matching the name of the spec file.

There are no command-line options for this program, and running a `cargo run` in the terminal will only result in running a program that rewrites the exact same files, because the output is versioned. The reason it is versioned is so that it leverages the Git ecosystem in regards to file comparison.

Check the [main.rs](main.rs) file, change the `SPECS_GIT_TAG` value with another [existing tag](https://github.com/starkware-libs/starknet-specs/tags), and then use Git to check for differences.
